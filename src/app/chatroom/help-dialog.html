  <mat-dialog-content class="mat-typography">
    <p>Place a bid proportional to how much you want to speak.</p>
    <p>You can adjust your bid amount by sliding the slider, and submit it by either releasing the slider or clicking the "Bid" button (you can adjust which one in your settings sidebar to the left).</p>
    <p>Your bid position will also be shown (e.g., if your bid is 2nd highest, you are 2nd in line to speak).</p>
    <p>The name of the current speaker in the discussion room will be displayed to everyone, as well as the amount of time they have left to speak. When it's your turn to speak, you have the option to end your turn early by clicking the "End my turn" button that shows up.</p>
    <p>When the moderator ends the discussion, you'll be shown your discussion stats, as well as average stats from the room.</p>
